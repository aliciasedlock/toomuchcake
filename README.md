#Grandma Made Too Much Cake

This is a game I made for the seventh installment of Purple Monkey Game Jam. The theme this time around was "too much of a good thing".

The goal of the game is to save your grandmother, as she has been buried under all the cakes she has made. Drag the cakes around to uncover grandma. But watch out, you only have so much time!

Made in HTML, CSS, and JS. Used hittest.js for PNG collision detection. Techically works on touch devices!
